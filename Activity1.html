<p>I’m Patrick Rosales and I’m 19 years old and, I live at Merville, Pasay City. During the first year of my Senior High, I’m not used in going somewhere alone, so I am nervous because it will be my first time travelling/commuting alone going to Asia Pacific College, so I think I can say that the nervousness I felt is an indicator that I kind of traveled by myself to place I can consider new for me. After staying in APC during my senior high school days, My friends and I, had a summer outing by ourselves, it was my first time going on a beach without my family, I was scared because we commuted by just following direction we found on the internet so I was nervous the whole time because I think that we might get lost, but fortunately, we didn’t, so for me I think that I had an unexpected adventure with my friends because I was able to do the things that I’m not used to. </p>

            My freshman year did go smoothly since I had credited subjects, so my subject load wasn’t that big and since the first year was more on general subjects, i had an idea since i took senior high here, so i was able to do advanced readings. I was able to relax and have fun with my friends. I spent my summer at home, playing games, eating, and sleeping, so I think that is enough for me because I prefer to maximize the vacation by relaxing at home, some would say that my summer is boring, but I am satisfied with what I’ve done the whole summer. Some would define summer vacation, as travelling, but I say that would depend in the person. Since I usually try to avoid asking money from my parents, i would only accept invitations if I have any spare money. The feelings I felt when I experienced those things I’ve mentioned are: nervousness and happiness, Since I usually have a good time with my friends, and we’ve been together for years, I am usually happy with them. I can say that I’m an optimist person, so sad/depressing things rarely affects me. 

            I expect this class <em>to be fun</em> because this includes designing which is one of my interests, I also expect this class to be also hard because this subject is I think is a fundamental part of my course as BSIT-MI since designing would be a vital part of making a program.
